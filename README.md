## About

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

For analytics, we use [Umami](https://umami.is/).
Why? Because Google Analytics should be (and in some places is) illegal.

This site was forked from the [Stuyvesant Weightlifting Club](https://stuywlc.com)'s site. (https://github.com/leomet07/stuywlc)
